The big addition for this release is a command-line tool, `mida`.

To use the tool, supply it with the urls or filenames that you
would like to be parsed (by default each item is output as yaml):
{% highlight bash %}
  mida http://lawrencewoodman.github.com/mida/news/
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to search for specific types you can use the `-t` switch
followed by a Regular Expression:
{% highlight bash %}
  mida -t /person/i http://lawrencewoodman.github.com/mida/news/
{% endhighlight %}

For more information look at `mida`'s help:
{% highlight bash %}
  mida -h
{% endhighlight %}

To see the complete list of changes, please have a look at the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/mida/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rdoc).
