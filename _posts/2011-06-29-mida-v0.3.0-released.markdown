The new release includes quite a few refinements such as auto registering the
vocabularies via the `inherited` hook and adding various `DataType`s such as
`Boolean`, `Float`, ISO8601Date, etc.
To improve output when using `pp` or `y` on `Item#to_h` the `vocabulary` has
been removed.

There are a couple of changes to watch out for:

* When describing a vocabulary `types` has been deprecated in favour of
  `extract`.  This was done in case greater flexibility was needed at a later
  date by providing `extract` with a block.  If this happens `extract` would
  make more sense as a name.
* `String` can no longer be used as a type when describing a `Vocabulary`,
  instead use `DataType::Text`
* Properties marked as `has_one` now output a single value instead of an `Array`
* `Document#search` now only uses a `Regexp` to search with as this greatly
   simplified the code

The project would benefit from greater collaboration, to aid this `Bundler`
support has been added.

To see the complete list of changes, please have a look at the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/mida/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rdoc).
