This version now contains all the [schema.org](http://schema.org) datatypes,
enumerations and vocabularies.  This was achieved by scraping the site using
[schema.org_scraper](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/schema.org_scraper)
to create a JSON and YAML representation of the types.  These are hosted
on [github](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/schema.org_schemas) so that the
changes can easily be tracked.

The main problem that I did encounter was that the [Enumeration](http://schema.org/Enumeration)
type conflicts with the explanation in the [Getting started Guide](http://schema.org/docs/gs.html#advanced_enum).
In the type list, it says that Enumeration is a vocabulary derived from [Thing](http://schema.org/Thing),
whereas in the explanation it says to uses the `<link>` tag to specify the
value of the enumeration.  The latter makes a lot more sense as otherwise it is
unclear which property should be used to specify the value.  I have therefore
created an `Enumeration` `DataType`, which can be subclassed to create an
`Enumeration` with specified valid values, as in the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
# The publication format of the book.
class BookFormatType < Mida::DataType::Enumeration
  VALID_VALUES = [
    [::Mida::DataType::URL, %r{http://schema.org/EBook}i],
    [::Mida::DataType::URL, %r{http://schema.org/Hardcover}i],
    [::Mida::DataType::URL, %r{http://schema.org/Paperback}i]
  ]
end
{% endhighlight %}

[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/mida/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rdoc).
